# Analysis_Fact_and_Cluster

This repo was created for our analysis in the final activity from our subject Multivariate Analysis at UFRGS.

So, me and Jo√£o (my colleague) made one work with two parts:

- Factorial Analysis 
- Clustering

We used the data provided by our teacher from a version of Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills.
